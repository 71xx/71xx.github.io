# German Foreign Policy 1870 - 1890 Notes:

## French Isolation
 - Germany wanted france to remain isolated
 - Bismarck wants all powers except france to need them
 - Should alliances be formed, Germany would be in the largest group

## Peace 
 - Germany wanted to remain at peace with its neighbours.

## Domestic Policy Pressures 
 - Foreign policy does not operate in isolation
 - Some historians have argued that domestic considerations were key in determining Germany foreign policy

## How effective was foreign policy 
 - Bismarck - pragmatist (did whatever he thought necessary)
 - Policy -  convoluted
 - 1879 – 1885 – relations with France were cordial (good)

## Bismarck was flexible? 
 - Germany was “a satiated power” in Bismarck’s words.
 - Interested in keeping peace and alliances.

## Alliances 
 - Italy (1882)
 - Romania(1883)
 - Three Emperors Alliance (1881)
 - Reinsurance treaty (1887)

### Complex Alliances
 - Mediterranean Agreements between Gt. Britain, AH, and Italy.  Although these did not involve Germany – the fact that their allies were linked to GB was a link!
 - Complex series of agreements denied the French allies
 - Bismarck was only one who understood them and so had a diplomatic advantage.
