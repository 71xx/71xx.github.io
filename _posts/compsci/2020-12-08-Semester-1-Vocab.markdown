# Semester 1 Vocabulary

 * Algorithm - A step by step approach to break up a computing problem into smaller problems and solve them one step at a time.
 * Pseudocode - Shorthand notation for programming which uses a combination of informal programming structures and verbal descriptions of code.
 * keyword - A word or phrase that describes a subject or category on which you can search.
 * reserved words - Words that have predefined meanings that cannot be changed.
 * Operators - The symbols with which you can specify the type of calculation you want to perform in an Excel formula.
 * Compiler - A program that translates code in a high-level language (such as Java) to machine instructions (such as bytecode for the Java virtual machine).
 * interpreter - Converts a program written in a higher level language into a lower level language and executes it, beginning execution before converting the entire program.
 * Syntax - the rules for combining words into grammatically sensible sentences in a given language
 * Semantics - Meaning of words and sentences
 * Debugger - a programming utility that helps programmers test and correct a computer program
 * Operand - An element that identifies the values to be used in a calculation.
 * Variable - A symbol used to represent a quantity that can change
 * constant - A value that does not change
 * syntax error - An error that results when an instruction does not follow the syntax rules or grammar of the programming language.
 * semantic error - An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the programmer intended.
 * run-time error - An error in a program that makes it impossible to run to completion. Usually occurs during execution. Also called an "exception".
 * if statement - The common programming structure that implements "conditional statements".
 * Loops - The computational concept of running the same sequence multiple times.
 * else - The part of code that runs when the IF () condition becomes FALSE.
 * AND operator - Logical operator in programming that becomes TRUE when BOTH inputs are TRUE
 * OR operator - Logical operator in programming that becomes TRUE if ONE of the inputs is TRUE
 * NOT operator - one of the logical operators; reverses the truth-value of a condition
 * Computational Thinking - A method of problem-solving that helps computer scientists prepare problems for digital solutions
 * Abstraction - Reducing information and detail to focus on essential characteristics.
 * Decomposition - Process of breaking down a bigger problem into smaller problems/units.
 * pattern recognition - looking for similarities among and within problems
 * algorithmic design - A way to create a mathematical plan to solve a problem.
 * array - A structured collection or list of things such as numbers, names and other data. Positions begin at 0.
 * Linear Search - a method for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched.
 * Binary Search - Looking for an item in an already sorted list by eliminating large (half) portions of the data on each comparison
 * Big O Notation - A way of expressing the worst-case run-time of an algorithm, useful for comparing the speed of two algorithms.
 * Strings - A data type in programming that accepts alphanumeric content.
 * nested loop - A loop inside the body of another loop. The inner most loop executes first. When it exits, the outer loop resumes next pass.
 * pre-condition - condition that must hold upon entry into a piece of code, such as a function or a loop
 * post-condition - condition that must hold upon exit from a piece of code such as a function or a loop
 * Functions - Chunks of code in programming that has a pre-defined purpose behind it. It can be called upon when that purpose needs to be it. Ex: findNextFreeBlock ( ) would go into a teacher's schedule at any time and return the next block of time that s/he is free.
 * Built-In Functions/Procedures - Functions that are pre-written and included as part of a programming language's environment.
 * User Defined Functions - Chunks or segments of code written by a programmer to solve a custom problem that cant be solved by a built in function.
 * Function Body - The body where the logic or operation for the function resides.
 * function signature - The name of a function along with the data type and order of its parameters makes up the signature of the function.
 * Function Parameters - variables declared inside the parentheses in a function heading defining the data that must be passed to the function when it is called
 * function argument - Variables or values passed to the function in its calling statement, if required.
 * function call - The place in your program where you call a function you have defined
 * Linear Search Big O - O
 * Binary Search Big O - O (log n)
 * Bubble Sort - A sort in which the first two items to be sorted are examined and exchanged if necessary to place them in the specified order; the second item is then compared with the third (exchanging them if required), the third is compared with the fourth, and the process is repeated until all pairs have been examined and all items are in the proper sequence.
 * Selection Sort - A sorting routine that uses a nested loop process to systematically select the best value among the unsorted elements of the array for the next position in the array, starting with position zero all the way to the end.
 * 2D array - An array that holds a set of arrays. Its data is organized by rows and columns, and usually represents grids, tables, or matrices.
 * bit - binary digit. A 1 or a 0.
 * Byte - a group of 8 bits
 * Hexadecimal - The hexadecimal number system is base 16, using only digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.
 * decimal - based on the number 10. Values only from 0 - 9.
 * Binary - The binary number system is base 2, using only bits 0 and 1.
 * logic gate - A circuit that produces an output based on the inputs
 * AND gate - A logic gate that takes in 2 inputs and only outputs True if both inputs are True
 * OR gate - Digital circuit that implements the OR operation. The output of this circuit is HIGH (logic level 1) if any or all of its inputs are HIGH.
 * NOT gate - Also called an INVERTER gate or an inverting buffer. A logic gate that changes its input logic level to the opposite state.
 * NAND Gate - A logic circuit whose output is 0 when all inputs are 1.
 * XOR Gate - A logic circuit whose output is 1 when one input is 1, but not both.
 * NOR Gate - Logic circuit that operates like an OR gate followed by an INVERTER. The output of a NOR gate is LOW (logic level 0) when any or all inputs are HIGH (logic level 1).
