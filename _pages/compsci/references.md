## Jekyll and GitHub Pages Setup Guide

Here you can find my guide on seting up a Jekyll site with github pages - [Here](/compsci/site-guide) 

## Web Dev

[DevHints Jekyll Cheat Sheet](https://devhints.io/jekyll) - Quite frankly this site would not be here without this cheat sheet

## Visual Studio Code 

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my favorite text editor for moderate tasks, like updating this site, though I still use PyCharm and Visual Studio for heavier work. Below is a list of the extensions and the theme I use.
